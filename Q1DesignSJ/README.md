Each of the requirements are fulfilled in the design. Air is recycled with the button on the bottom-right depicting three arrows in a circle. The fan speed is controlled by the bar on the left side with the fan next to it. Windshield de-fog is found on the button in the very bottom-right with the three arrows pointing upward. The vent positions are the buttons in the bottom-middle with a person sitting in a seat for reference. Temperature control is maintained with the rectangular bar in the center of the UI next to the thermometer.


For customers in other countries, I chose to allow for convenient selection of units for the degrees. With one tap, the whole UI will change from Fahrenheit to Celsius or the other way around. I also chose to use pictures to describe each feature rather than words to minimize language barriers.

Honestly, I wasn't sure how to go about accomodating people with disabilities. In my mind, if they are too debilitated to operate the A/C, then they are not well enough to drive.

I feel like accounting for weather conditions is one of the fundamental jobs of an A/C unit. Temperature control is what allows the user to be comfortable during hot or cold times. With my design, I wanted to minimize the amount of time the user needs to spend touching the screen. When driving, having your eyes and hands focus on anything but driving can turn into a serious disaster. That's why the main bars on my UI (the fan speed and temperature bars) have shortcuts implemented so that you can tap on the bar itself to jump to a preset value, rather than always have to click the arrows repeatedly to adjust the levels of each.
