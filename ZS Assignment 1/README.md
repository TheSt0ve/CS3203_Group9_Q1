# Q1-Za-Sing
 
Since this touchscreen will be in a car, I tried to keep the UI simple.

The air recycle and windshield defrost are simple toggles with their standard symbols.
The vent position buttons are similar, with one for upper and one for lower. These would be able to be activated together, for the fans to blow out of upper and lower.
Each of these buttons would have a colored highlight to signify which ones are activated.

The fan speed has five levels that can be raised or lowered by pressing the "up" or "down" arrows. Each little block on the indicator will fill up to whatever level the fan is set to.
The temperature control is similar, with a small display of the temperature (in F) with a blue "minus" and a red "plus" to indicate raising or lowering the temperature. This goes one degree at a time, But I thought this is the next easiest (and safest) option in absence of a physical knob.
Each of these settings could also be held instead of needing multiple taps.

All of these buttons would be relatively large so anyone could safely and easily activate, and they would use symbols similar to most cars, so their functions would be easy to understand. The only thing that could pose a problem for different countries would be the temperature scale, but maybe that could be set by the seller. These options would be safe for different driving conditions, as all the buttons are large and easy to access without taking your eyes off the road for long.
